The Ablation_experiments_v1.png illustrates the latest results from ablation experiments conducted at different values of $\beta$ under FixW-TU and Adw-TU conditions. 
Upon examination of the Ablation_experiments_v1.png file, the DRL-TU-Adw consistently produced the best results across various threshold values for updating $\beta$.
